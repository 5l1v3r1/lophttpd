Some things that you can tune to have optimum performance
in general:

- Increase value inside /proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn to have larger
  connection backlog queue (try 10000, this is what lhttpd will use)
- have the logfile's on a different HDD than the webroot
- If firewall policy allows, mark HTTP traffic as not-conntracked:
  iptables -t raw -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j NOTRACK
- Whenever possible use the "mmap" log provider, it really rocks. 
  (it requires the logfiles to be MB aligned, so you may need to remove
   them first if you previously didnt use the mmap provider)
- split large directories (dirs containing like 100k files) into smaller ones
  if you use autoindexing, as most web browsers cannot render large tables fastly
