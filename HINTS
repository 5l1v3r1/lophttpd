Some things that you can tune to have optimum performance
in general:

- Increase value inside /proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn to have larger
  connection backlog queue (try 10000, this is what lhttpd will use)
  On FreeBSD thats 'sysctl -w kern.ipc.somaxconn=10000'

- have the logfile's on a different HDD than the web-root

- If firewall policy allows, mark HTTP traffic as not-conntracked:
  iptables -t raw -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j NOTRACK
  iptables -t raw -A OUTPUT -p tcp --sport 80 -j NOTRACK

  This really buys you connection performance.

- Whenever possible use the "mmap" log provider, it really rocks.
  (it requires the log-files to be MB aligned, so you may need to remove
   them first if you previously didn't use the mmap provider)

- split large directories (dirs containing like 100k files) into smaller ones
  if you use auto-indexing, as most web browsers cannot render large tables fastly

- If you have large bandwidth and a lot of connections, consider to increase your
  TCP send buffers via /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_wmem (min, default, max)

- for a large BDP, consider using tcp-westwood or other congestion avoidance algorithms
  (modprobe tcp_weswood and tune /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_*)

- You can experiment with lophttpd's send-size scheduling algorithms by
  enabling -DSTATIC_SEND_SIZE_COMPUTATION compile time switch. This will decrease
  the chunk-size of sendfile() by 128 Bytes for each N-clients/MANY_RECEIVERS.
  MANY_RECEIVERS can be tuned too at compile time (enum). The chunk-size will never
  be less than 64 and never be larger than 4096.
  By default, lophttpd will check the currents socket send-queue and will decrease
  the chunk-size if its still filled from the last send.
  However, if you have ~10k parallel connections and quite slow down-link,
  -DSTATIC_SEND_SIZE_COMPUTATION might be helpful since smaller files are still
  delivered smoothly.
  You can always force a chunk-size via -S switch (other than 1024), which will not
  be re-calculated by lophttpd, in case you found a value that perfectly fits into
  your network.

- The default number of maximum allowed parallel connections is set to 10,000 (per core).
  If you experience some DoS which tries to exceed that, you can always increase it via -N,
  so that it would be hard to reach from DSL up-links. However if just the attackers
  up-link is large enough, he can DoS any web server. Thats known and should be prevented
  on the border router. If you have smaller files to deliver (some KB) its hard to DoS you,
  if you deliver MB sized files, its easier, as even legit connections last longer and
  keep the -N parameter high.
  In such cases you should consider traffic shaping for dedicated IP networks.
  Netfilter is your friend.
